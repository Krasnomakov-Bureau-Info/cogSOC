## üß¨ Evolution Path

0. ‚ö™ Informational Bureau (current stage)
1. üü¢ Live tracking and informing (conceptual/analytical)
2. üü° Active incident responding (simulated/analytical)
3. üü† Active threat hunting (evolving from defense to attack stage)
4. üî¥ Advanced analytical modeling of adversary TTPs (simulated)

> **Note:** The "evolution path" above is a conceptual framework for analytical maturity, not a commitment to operational activity.

<summary><strong>‚ö°Ô∏è Energy and Experience Protocol</strong></summary>

### Principle of Growth
The evolution of CogSOC is fueled by accumulating **Energy** and **Experience**. Articles are the primary means of generating these resources, with the goal of reaching **100-150 units** to advance to the next stage.

### The Nature of Articles
- **Reactive, Not Reflective:** Articles are published as reactive responses to events. However, the topic of an article is not a direct mirror of the event that prompted it. Instead, articles are analytical reactions that, in aggregate, serve a single purpose. At this stage, they do not contain direct facts, document specific violations, or make accusations.

### Energy Calculation (Effort & Risk)
Energy is a measure of the resources required to produce an article, categorized by topic. More abstract or general articles cost less, while more specific and sensitive ones cost more.
- **Minimal Cost (`~0.005`):** `Humor`.
- **Low Cost (`~0.01`):** `History`, general `Definitions`.
- **Moderate Cost:** `Future Threats` and `Future Defenses`, due to their speculative nature.
- **High Cost:** `Observations` and `Attacks`, as they are based on analyzing real-world events and acknowledged threats.
- **Variable Cost:** `Defense` articles have a cost equivalent to the `Attack` they are designed to counter.
- *The maximum energy per article is 1.0 unit.*

### Experience Calculation (Utility & Applicability)
Experience is a measure of an article's usefulness and applicability in real-world conditions.
- **Specificity is Key:** The more an article details a concrete scheme, the actors involved, or specific situations where a tactic is practiced, the more experience it yields.
- **Practical Value:** Actionable `Defense` strategies that can be readily applied also generate significant experience.

### Transition to Arsenal
All documented cognitive and cyber attacks, along with their corresponding defenses, transition into the **CogSOC arsenal**. As the project evolves and real-world data is confirmed, this knowledge base will support the more advanced phases outlined in the evolution model, including the development of a distributed SOC and, eventually, active pursuit capabilities.

### Additional Growth Vectors
Accumulating energy and experience is also pursued through:
- Public awareness campaigns (advertising).
- Formal inquiries to relevant authorities.
- Collaboration with other organizations in the privacy and security sectors.

<summary>üåç <strong>CogSOC Principles</strong></summary>

- Independent private initiative focused on research and public education in civil protection and resilience, not affiliated with any state, political party, or organization.
- Institutionally neutral and nonpartisan: does not take positions on social or political disputes beyond its mission; analytical judgments are made without regard to nationality, ideology, or current politics.
- Non-governmental and self-directed: no external financing or patronage; no donor, sponsor, or institution has review or influence over content or priorities.
- Non-operational and non-violent: conducts open-source analysis and public-interest explanations related to cognitive/information risks; does not coordinate, incite, or conduct operations against persons or organizations.
- Civil defense context: contributes to public awareness, preparedness, and protection of civilians against contemporary information/cognitive risks through prevention, mitigation, and education, consistent with the educational aspects of civil protection.

> Like a newspaper. _At this stage._


If the situation gets worse, it gains energy and experience ‚Äî and will provide an actively managed database of actors, parties, and real data about events and operations that it is tracking.


**Primary goal:**

> Development of an effective cyber cognitive kill chain, accessible by anyone, anywhere ‚Äî allowing to successfully disrupt operations. Check **taxonomy** directory.
