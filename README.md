## ⚡️ Lele: 0 (basic)


> **Stage:** `Zero` — _Informational Bureau_
>
> 📝 _Not tracking live operations, not responding, but providing information._


In order to evolve into the next stage, it requires **energy** and **experience**.


**Current energy level:** `.020`  
**Current experience level:** `.020`

## 🧬 Evolution Path

0. ⚪ Informational Bureau (current stage)
1. 🟢 Live tracking and informing (conceptual/analytical)
2. 🟡 Active incident responding (simulated/analytical)
3. 🟠 Active threat hunting (evolving from defense to attack stage)
4. 🔴 Advanced analytical modeling of adversary TTPs (simulated)

> **Note:** The "evolution path" above is a conceptual framework for analytical maturity, not a commitment to operational activity.

<summary>🌍 <strong>CogSOC Principles</strong></summary>

- Independent private initiative focused on research and public education in civil protection and resilience, not affiliated with any state, political party, or organization.
- Institutionally neutral and nonpartisan: does not take positions on social or political disputes beyond its mission; analytical judgments are made without regard to nationality, ideology, or current politics.
- Non-governmental and self-directed: no external financing or patronage; no donor, sponsor, or institution has review or influence over content or priorities.
- Non-operational and non-violent: conducts open-source analysis and public-interest explanations related to cognitive/information risks; does not coordinate, incite, or conduct operations against persons or organizations.
- Civil defense context: contributes to public awareness, preparedness, and protection of civilians against contemporary information/cognitive risks through prevention, mitigation, and education, consistent with the educational aspects of civil protection.

> Like a newspaper. _At this stage._


If the situation gets worse, it gains energy and experience — and will provide an actively managed database of actors, parties, and real data about events and operations that it is tracking.


**Primary goal:**

> Development of an effective cyber cognitive kill chain, accessible by anyone, anywhere — allowing to successfully disrupt operations.
