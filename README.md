# 🧠 CogSOC


## ⚡️ Lele: 0 (basic)


> **Stage:** `Zero` — _Informational Bureau_
>
> 📝 _Not tracking live operations, not responding, but providing information._


In order to evolve into the next stage, it requires **energy** and **experience**.


**Current energy level:** `0`  
**Current experience level:** `0`

## 🧬 Evolution Path

1. 🟢 Live tracking and informing
2. 🟡 Active incident responding
3. 🔴 Countering and following threats (attack stage)

<details>
<summary>🌍 <strong>CogSOC Principles</strong></summary>

- Operates as part of **international civil defense**
- Does **not** differentiate nationalities, countries, or politics
- Not financed or patronized
- Cannot be influenced or shut down — it is a **mirror of modern events**

</details>


> Like a newspaper. _At this stage._


If the situation gets worse, it gains energy and experience — and will provide an actively managed database of actors, parties, and real data about events and operations that it is tracking.


**Primary goal:**

> Development of an effective cyber cognitive kill chain, accessible by anyone, anywhere — allowing to successfully disrupt operations.
